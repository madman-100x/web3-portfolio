# 👋 Hello, I'm madman_100x

I'm new to the Web3 space — curious, motivated, and learning by doing.

Currently exploring how I can contribute through:
- 🧠 Community engagement (Telegram, Discord)
- ✍️ Caption writing & content support
- 🛠️ Light task execution (non-coding)
- 📄 Basic documentation and editing

📂 This GitHub will serve as my growing portfolio as I learn and contribute to the Web3 ecosystem.
