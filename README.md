## ðŸ”¹ NFT Experiments

Exploring 2D digital NFTs with abstract and symbolic visuals.  
Some items contain hidden puzzle elements.  
The goal isnâ€™t just visual appeal â€” but to trigger thought.

## ðŸ”¹ Ongoing Mysterious NFT Project

Currently developing a long-term NFT project with an approach that hasnâ€™t been done before.  
Based on mystery, hidden layers of logic, and existential structure.  
This is not just another NFT â€” it's an experiment in digital legacy, riddles, and the limits of human comprehension.  
The project wonâ€™t be revealed here, but it remains a key part of this portfolio.

I made this project because i feel like most nfts today are boring. they're either just pretty pictures or hype with no soul.  
i wanted to make something more interactive, something that pulls people in, makes them think, explore, even get lost.  
hopefully this kind of project can push nft storytelling into new territory. something that actually feels alive.

Some projects cannot be explained... only discovered.


This GitHub is my weird little basecamp while I build in public.
