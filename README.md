# 👋 Hello, I'm madman_100x

I'm exploring the edges of creativity in the Web3 space — curious, driven, and unafraid to build things that make no sense... until they do.

## What I'm working on
🎭 **12 Steps Before the End** — an absurd, mysterious NFT experience on Solana.  
A collection of 12 cryptic NFTs that might lead to a 13th.  
Or maybe the 13th doesn't exist.  
But the treasure? Very real.

## How I contribute
🧠 Community engagement (Telegram, Discord)  
✍️ Narrative design & mystery content  
🛠️ NFT & experimental drop mechanics  
📄 Documentation, puzzle logic, and campaign strategy  

This GitHub is my weird little basecamp while I build in public.
